63 - Making people understand, acknowledge or even care about their hypocrisy regarding race and racism in this country requires them to view those that they’re displaying inconsistency towards as human. It’s a losing battle when it pertains to us.
64 - What I hate the most is someone talking behind my back
65 - But there were no planes, yes they put the explosives in the buildings, and kill anyone who talks.....we need everyone to stand up against them, but there's too many in power. Tired of hearing about all we can do, we can't do shit. Need some good power players to clean house

112 - Like the rest of the 'de-bunkers' your tactic is to condescend and ridicule while side stepping all visual evidence and direct questions about water vapor. Why are you trying so hard to convince so many that their own eyes and life experiences lie to them? Why would you do that?
113 - bout to rewatch power bc i hate effie and seeing tariq ho her while looking fine AF did sum to meh 
114 - Hey! I just came across you on here for the first time. It took me a little over a minute to figure out that you are a disgusting, vile, poor excuse for a human being.I wish you nothing but the worst.
115 - Why do the Serbs compete in NATO countries, why do they move so voluntarily to the NATO states if they hate the west and NATO so much? Why don’t they boycott the west and move and play in russia, their brothers in blood and hatred? Suddenly they forget their strong opinions?

147 - Not only Muhammad didn't abolish slavery, he personally captured women with his army and kept as sex slaves females after beheading males (ex: Banu Qurayza)

Rosenbaum - threatened to kill him, ambushed him and tried to take his gun.

166 - It is actually very LGBT-friendly.  There are large, thriving communities in Orlando and Miami.  There are laws in Florida are for the protection of children. Notably the parental rights act.  End of the day, if you are an adult, that's your business, but don't mess with minors…

289 - They hate every extreme MAGA guy with every fiber of their being, and they cite 1/6 as the worst day ever. And they want everyone involved to suffer in prison.

Means time is running out for russian troops: either they frag their officers soon and flee to russia or the officers will flee to russia and leave the troops to die.
299 - Yeah. I think they hate when Levert picks on Brunson worse than when Garland does it. Brunson isn’t’ quite quick enough to stay with Garland consistently, but it’s still better than him being out-quicked *and* out-sized by Levert. Osman is food.

311 - Desperate for attention. Palace legal letter forced a revision, but the narc in her couldn’t let it go. This is basically her recap of the last 3 years, hoping it  would trigger some sympathy for her and hate for the RF. 
Unfortunately for her, it’s not working.

339 - Because c9mmunists don't work on a 4 year cycle they work on a generational cycle and young people will be around to vote more and be dependent in them so they can continue to lie cheat steal and destroy. Old people are easier to kill with covid and remember their con. Rights
340 - You will die sooner tho

343 - I don't listen to  Christians. They have a lot of pedophiles. I'm also not a atheist & wouldn't let them guide my views. Even historical history is often guess work with historians having different views. I took my uncles view. If I believe, die & no God. I didn't lose a thing.

361 - There isn’t one. That’s why you Communists hate America so much. The very heavily armed American people are in your god dam way. It’s a universal right here in America that the government cannot infringe upon the right to bear arms. Cry about it
362 - With all these hashtags & tweets the Ukraine War has become the first "Social Media War". It's disgusting, war shouldn't be glorified like this.
363 - I keep coming back because you keep coming back lol.... Talk about the pot calling the kettle black huh haha

You mad insecure and it's hilarious

365 - the LGBT community lost their minds when this happened
366 - I just thought the game was mid. I didn’t hate it or anything.
367 - Why would you want to kill anyone ?
368 - There you go. Now we're talking a real problem. Global depopulation needs both local and global decapitalisation strategies as well. It'll be a very bumpy ride economically. We won't be likely experiencing that here mind you. Climate change refugees are likely to fill labour gaps
369 - Why would you want to kill anyone ?

379 - doesn’t widow’s ult and literally hard counter sombra? plus is widow just gets a bit of healing, a semi-decent widow will kill the sombra because it doesn’t even take long for her rifle to charge
380 - I think we have to have the confidence to regard TERFs as inane and pathetic rather than trying this 'productive debate' approach; 'productive debate' should really be reserved for things which are almost immediate non-issues (eg the monarchy)
381 - i hate when people WHO NEVER been pregnant, try to speak on how bellies grow , like girl is you slow????

386 - tri-Pride in-person Board meeting this morning, 4/6 of us had ADHD fidget aids.  Love being around folks who get it, also so curious about the overlap of queerness & neurodivergence. And no, I don't want hate trolls' theories. But I am going to read some studies. #2SLGBTQIA+
387 - If the British left had bothered to do its reading about the Ukraine Solidarity Campaign and its penchant for historical revisionism then Paul Mason would not be getting away with calling anyone far right, let me tell you
388 - i hate when ppl wanna act so serious when they know it’s a damn joke… jus go along with it :|
389 - When like everyone cursing me 

I hate them but I am so weak like cannot do anything to them but hate

Our heart is not strong enough not to forgive

But people find it funny
390 - 6) you do not believe in the God of the Bible. You only care about using scripture as weapon of destruction in the lives of people you are already predisposed to hate.

7) God is not amused by your failure to follow God's most important commands, to love God and your neighbor.
391 - Ikr, this guy's fans always the first one to hate on wzh and yx 
392 - i hate this nigga .

396 - along with Michael Byrd who had no reason to kill Ashli Babbitt.
397 - Hard to believe that Obama is considered the greatest president of the 21st century by many and the strongest opinions he had were:

1) Health care for all (lol jk)

2) Ketchup doesn’t go on a Hot Dog

3) You can kill American citizens and people at weddings with drone strikes

402 - @AndyShep_CPOM
 
There is a lot that can be done, and most "solutions" can be tackled from the ground up (by individuals) and from the top down (i.e., legislated).
I am surprised that change of diet to vegan has not peaked in this stats, i.e., Poore & Newek, 2018:
403 - Can you guess the top 3 most effective climate solutions?

Its not rocket science; wind, solar, and (retaining) trees 
404 - Wow they’re all the ones that hate Trump.. wonder why?
405 - Proposed a 22% cut to veteran's benefits, didn't they? Considering an E4 makes about the same as a shift manager at a fast food joint, I'd say they're headed in the wrong direction. These men and women already have waiting lists for medical care a mile long. It's disgraceful.
406 - What a disgusting lot.
407 - oh thats the worst, you literally feel like you’re gonna die kanti you’re falling asleep. 
408 - hate the sin, have discernment. I reject the insanity forced upon children just as Jesus does. GOD USES US AS SOLDIERS TO DETER HARM ON THE defenseless, adults grooming kids WE WILL NOT STAND FOR.
409 - Bartiromo told McCarthy that President Biden had called the Gqp bill "wacko."
"Did you threaten to allow the nation to default?" Bartiromo said.
"No, we're the only ones in Washington that are actually putting a responsible plan out that will raise the debt limit," McCarthy lied.
410 - We end the week in the red after back to back good weeks … look to end April with a bang

411 - So far your contribution to this thread has been to call someone you disagree with politically  a commie, just like right wingers have been doing to anyone left of Ronald Reagan for the past 50 years, but please do go on about how others are motivated by hate but not you.
412 - you guys just hate when women know they’re hot like let’s be real. She was harming no one and if you were distracted that’s not her problem
413 - As someone who recently changed parties from D to R, I can tell you this is not true. "MAGA" does not hate anyone based on identity politics. "MAGA" is against identity politics. The only party promoting this festering decay is the democrats.
414 - If you’re Jewish…MAGA hates you….the majority of the GOP endorses them by staying silent. 

If you’re LGTBQ…MAGA hates you….and the majority of the GOP endorses them by staying silent. 

If you’re African American…MAGA hates you….and the majority of the GOP endorses…

421 - Bts gets hate just bc of a song (dynamite) and their visuals, Taylor gets hated bc she is the best female artist and people can’t accept it   Been a fan of Taylor since I was a kid and always danced her songs and bts are my comfort place now  this is peace

524 - Miami Heat guard Victor Oladipo has suffered a season-ending torn patellar tendon in his left knee, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium. Just another injury the two-time All-Star will work to overcome.

534 - Bring brutal Kratos back, his soft side sucks... Kill atreyus and make him go Berserk!
535 - As I've said for years, it's because THEY'RE NOT RELYING ON VOTES to bring them to power. They'd given up on democracy doing that before #RedDon came down that escalator.

They're relying on their base being fired up enough TO KILL THEIR FELLOW AMERICANS. #SeditiousConspiracy
536 - No one on the Democratic side is asking why, despite reportedly large losses in 2020 and 2022 the GOP didn't even pause for half a second on their agenda. They continue attacking women's reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights and voting rights unabated and in some ways taken their

565 - Hi I just realised something while listening to Rosumand reading Moiraine's "Weep for Manetheren" speech from the books. Was King Aemon Queen Eldrene's warder??? It says she felt him die how else if not through the bond? is this common knowledge? why am I just discovering this??

The organised crime bosses are probably more important don't you think?
571 - Lots of hype for this scene but I. . . Kinda hate it? It kinda feels like a rehash of the previous movie and an attempt to one up it but worse then that I hate the goofy tone. This is a scene where the whole school is destroyed and a character dies and he's just memeing.

583 - If everything you want is a “right”, nothing is a right. If everything/everyone is “racist”, then nothing/no one is racist. If words or speech that you disagree with are all “hate”, then nothing is hate. Cry “wolf” 24/7/365? That’s why nobody takes you seriously.

601 - Moodys definitely not the Canary in the Coalmine. More like the Ambulance driver that takes first 100 Coalminers to die to the Hospital.  Cant they read financial statements. SVB was insolvent on their Dec 2022 quarterly statement filed.
602 - Hate comes in speech too. Don’t ignore.
603 - i hate that shit i don’t know how to read signals for shit

687 - Dude what?? Do you even know how laws are made? Just because there is a majority religous population, the govt system isn't tied to that religion. It only applies to Islam and even then, countries with 80-90 percent Muslims still have secular govt and foreign policy. Look it up
688 - The strides the LGBT community has made in the last few years are unfortunately being withered away in the red states. It's only a matter of time before the GOP sets its sights not just on trans people, but back onto the wider LGBT community.

703 - Babies die because mortal bodies suffer illness, miscarriages & death. Kids don’t get cancer because they are sinners, women don’t miscarry b/c of sin, but b/c mortal bodies are flawed. The eternal spirit is different than the mortal body-sin harms the spirit. Babies are innocent
704 - i would kill for that

742 - Except for the wanting to kill or harm part, the rest is 100% accurate portrayal of you and your hating grifting ilk.
743 - Failure to appreciate development was always wild for me. RJ's pedigree & resume screamed winner. He's literally been youngest rotation plyr for each of FOUR YEARS. I suspect NYK's fan's hate for RJ was latent bitterness in not being able to draft Zion or Ja
744 - While I sympathize with your feelings, in this case they’re marching on Mexico City to protest immigrant detention centers.

767 - Abbott was thinking of her hatred for Jews, and her disdain for the rights and sensibilities of other minorities. This is plain race-hate similar to the mutterings of Whoopi Goldberg, in the shadow of Farrakhan.
768 - Diane Abbott should already have been suspended from the Labour Party. Here is why (thread)...>>
769 - I don't know about you but tonight's game absolutely feels like a do or die, and I'm stressed out
770 - So he needs to supplement that until he figures his shit out. The simplest way to do that is to grift a cult that has proven they are die-hard loyal subjects. It's only $8 a month, though. Who cares he lied about making everyone pay.

774 - will u rather he be killed or something. He is the way he is, if you don't like it, ignore and move on. DOn't bring hate, it is not good, that is what we are trying to say. If you don't want your son like that, keep it on your TL, and don't bring negativity to someone's page.
775 - Yet they murdered a village of innocence and didn’t bat an eye when they found out. No actions any of them took up until that point said they care about innocent people. Especially at the expense of waller immediately being able to kill them
776 - This is the second police  brutality video I’ve seen in the past five minutes. 

Here, early reports indicate police violently protected a hate group outside of a drag show and refused to allow paramedics to treat their injured victims.
777 - Videos of police detaining people who came out to defend a drag show at Fort Brewery and Pizza in Fort Worth have been shared by @EFJBGC and by the anti-LGBTQ group "Protect Texas Kids." @fortworthpd will not comment on why, said it's "being investigated."

See things for what they truly are.
Recognize that outside forces can’t hurt you. Gain perspective, and use it to understand your purpose.
Remember that you’ll die. That thought should be motivating, not frightening.

841 - Don't make me kill you
842 - Crimes against humanity if it was even remotely helpful. Deliberately trying to kill people.
843 - Never forget while Dr Sabine Hazan was successfully treating the Hollywood elite with Hydroxychloroquine,  those very same elites were doing everything they  could to deny average citizens access to the drug -  knowing by so, people would die.
844 - disgusting
845 - My friends also do this with me and I feel terrible...

859 - I hate John collins so much
860 - That would legally be murder. Legally,  if you respond to stop an attack, it's  self defense.  If you shoot to kill, it's manslaughter or murder. The kid wasn't a threat anymore.  He had a face full of glass and a  crippled shoulder.  He couldn't shoot or aim anymore.
861 - omg did both of them just die
862 - I've asked you one very basic question about water vapor not dissipating over several hours time and you've ignored it.
863 - Rabbit punches to the back of the head can literally kill and paralyze you. I’d take a liver shot over that.
864 - That's why sextoys exist, if you hate men being physically and emotionally intimate with them is 100% avoidable. I know you can't avoid us 100% bc we share society, but intimacy isn't necessary.
865 - That’s crazy tho. I hate to laugh at it but like a jewish dude kickin out some spoiled kid literally led to an attempted cleansing of his people
866 - Half the people who like Makima don't know Makima, they just see "oh my god mommy! Mommy!" When in reality she's a damn sociopath who'd probably kill you. She's not "mommy" 
867 - also I literally can’t believe I have to say this but even if you missed out on the vinyl there is absolutely NO need to go around telling other people you hate them because they managed to get one??? just be fucking nice and congratulate them.
868 - i hate maryland so bad. ain’t shit to do here.
869 - Mental illness is really really bad these days….. I hate to say it but some people need help badly and it shows

875 - rihanna die for u ai cover omg my heart
876 - When you are successful, there will always be people who feel compelled to find something to hate about you.  Just remain true to yourself, that is the most important thing. You will never be able to make everyone happy, so make sure you are happy with yourself.

882 - I hate to eat and run but call the midwife is on in ten minutes
883 - no i 1000000% hate you rn
884 - That whole deal with the shuttles on the KFT is ridiculous. I always hate when something other than golf affects the end result…especially when it means so much to these guys. This seems like an easy one to not enforce if things are as they seem. What are your thoughts?
885 - Hmmmm interesting. Most of the time when I ask someone why they don't like the episode it's because they hate Clara and wish Jenna had left in that episode like she'd originally planned to. Or they hate 12 and Clara together. I've never heard anyone have a plot issue. 
886 - hobi's voice in Huh?! at some point might kill me
887 - Look I think Darkstalker is fuck up in the head and probably has something on reversible mental damage and I think he should die and, go onto purgatory or something and meet up with his enemies and have a fight that will last for eons instead of becoming Hope
888 - His take is utterly ridiculous as is the take of any worthwhile human life that measures anything in it by Twitter followers.  Go die somewhere alone.

891 - About once a year, my grandpa calls me to get help setting a new desktop background. I used to hate these calls. But now, I enjoy them. I don't see him often, so these calls are nice. Hearing him exited over the new background is always a treat. Anyways, today I got that call.
892 - i will hate myself in the morning for not sleeping earlier
893 - The liberal-culture that plauges the west is a complete system, which has every component of a religion. I have no hate for Islam, but it is simply not an ahistorical miracle. It's a worldview like any other. In fact it's very similar to other worldviews from that era.
894 - I hate being an over thinker
895 - So what. She is disgusting end of story 
896 - 22-Year-Old model Taylor Michelle has revealed she has been trolled after not shaving her body hair for 6 months.

906 - But they are not too young to drive a car that can crash and hurt someone or kill someone or hurt them and, of they don't die, loose a leg or an arm or maybe don't ever walk again? They are not too young for that?
907 - she was calling xiao

917 - i find it funny how many people hate lewis and his fans
918 - The face of hate

920 - Right like please! Men gonna hate me every time cuz imma call them on it. 1+1=2 you will not tell me it’s 5 & i just go with it 
921 - I absolutely love & value my life. I wouldn’t have known if the sperm or the egg that made me had not made it, and I wouldn’t have known if I had been aborted. It’s my love for life that helped me become pro-choice after learning another pregnancy would unexpectedly kill me.
922 - i will never hate lover its cuz of what london boy has done. from me! point of view.
923 - I've seen some ridiculous false accusations lately.. Remember to always ask for proof before jumping on the hate train
924 - Hate how they've appropriated so many symbols
925 - Done
926 - they stand for muscular man and hate feminine men
927 - It’s no coincidence church attendance is low & hate group numbers are increasing. The GOP purposely intertwines religion & politics to garner the evangelical vote. It wasn’t a fluke that Trump picked Pence as his running mate. They’ll use any means necessary to control Americans.
928 - No kids had a problem until creeps told you whom and how to hate. Conservative solutions harm kids in order to score political points. In a year or two they will move on to another scare tactic and you will hate that one too...like all of the others through the years.
929 - I hate missing sb that did me wrong like am I slow or some ?
930 - What power? I don't recall him taking away the truth. Which would be that trump LOST the election by over 7m votes, he's the first president ever to be arrested. The first LOSER to ever be impeached twice, He help thousands of his supporters kill themselves by staying unvaxxed
931 - Our kind won't die out because we procreate and raise other like minded humans. Your kind will die out because you believe in fantasies and lies and choose not to procreate - and for that we are all thankful.
932 - Everyone thinks that they’re the hero of the story. The difference is that your party tries to overthrow elections, stop marriage equality, take away healthcare, take food needy families, kidnap immigrant babies, discriminate against LGBTQ peoples, and burn books.
933 - Yoink. #JukeboxBrain is my new favorite saying. Thanks for that; and the Roger Miller Greatest Hits that'll be running thru my brain all night.

936 - Looks like it was Asian Hate Crime. By Blacks.
937 - Idk, I thought the Dark Horse album was pretty good. The hate is definitely over the top.
938 - There is ZERO difference between FOX, CNN, MSNBC.  It’s all propaganda.  ALL of it.

Their job is to get you to hate your neighbor, rather than the war-hungry Neoliberals running our government.
939 - Don’t u hate when ya man in another room laughing!? … cuz what else bringing u joy besides me?! 
940 - Why do millions of people convert to Islam? Why is Islam the fastest-growing religion if so terrible?  Islam does not need him he needs Islam. These are questions you should ask yourself not twitter

960 - I hate saying it because I have never liked the fucking guy but Tom Brady would be on the list long before Tiger Woods would imo
961 - Most disgusting is that Google calls him a warrior for good and praises his philanthropy. Read books by WW2 scholars prior to Google and see the real monster. He turned in his neighbors to the Nazis as Jews for a percentage of their wealth. After the war, he feigned victimhood
962 - Curiosity really did kill the cat 
963 - MSM is bought and paid off! Why Trump is the best. He doesn't need the money and they couldn't buy him. So the libtards hate him. Pathetic!

228 - One of the failures of the Unitary plan is the Terraced House & Apartment Building Zone to deliver 5-7 storey development that it targets.
Amalgamation is rare so we just get 3 storey townhouses. Basically side yards & height in relation to boundary requirements kill good density
229 - Perhaps the council planners are assuming that developers will amalgamate sites. Auckland has shown us (in a much more in-demand market) that this simply does not happen very often.

285 - No one is forcing anything on you. We all know you are nothing but a vile and wicked person who wants to kill people for not beings like you. You are a brainwashed, gullible fool, using your religion to justify wanting to kill people. Am I sure your Western god is proud of you.
286 - You’re right. You convinced me! Let’s remove all laws!! ALL! Like, you don’t care about murder laws - let’s get rid of ‘em! Then we can give out your address to all the libs and you can have a fun day using each other for target practice! Freedom to kill anyone who bugs me? YEAH!

322 - The people that are told one day that men can be women and blindly adopt that impossibility were also easily trained by the media to hate Trump. Many can't say exactly why they FEEL that way.
323 - I am biased towards older men, so I can go with yaga totally. Or naobito, principal gakuganji, Miguel (& Yuta in africa).

342 - he is THE big brother and I am willing to die on that hill
343 - something i FORGOT to say in my last thread is how denji is struggling in poverty and how he deals with it. he does not mind poverty. he is used to it. but he doesn’t want that for nayuta so he does up the apartment, and saves all the money he can. for her. (1/2)
344 - Mexicans don't hate Gervonta as much as they hated Floyd. When I tell you they HATEDDDD Floyd mannn lol

348 - I like how it’s just one cup at a time, but I hate the thought of the trash the pods would create. I normally use powdered espresso and that’s fine but not as fancy. It’s turmoil lol
349 - I'd say there are more important things in the world to worry about than if someone randomly has a check mark. Touch grass, lighten up & stop spreading hate.
350 - //I have never understood the hate, I've always really liked them!
351 - Witnesses say the perp asked “are you gay?” 

Victim “yes I’m gay”

Perp “ima kill you for being gay”

358 - Wow, this will seal the deal.   (Of being corrupt as hell.) for SCOTUS.

Big Oil shielded from regulation?
By all means, fvk over the American people again, take your boat trips with gagilionaires, kill women, shoot our kids.

By all means, pretend to be judges.
359 - SCOTUS will soon decide whether to hear a case that would shield Big Oil from regulation

Alito owns stock in ConocoPhillips & Phillips 66, both named in the suits

Barrett’s dad was a lawyer for Shell for 29 yrs

BOTH refused to recuse themselves

SCOTUS is a den of corruption
360 - i hate him with my whole heart.
361 - *I'm usually 

Autocorrect, I hate you so much.
362 - I have heard about that before.
The most common thing is, i think, to cry, hate, love, but also physical pain. Interesting and disturbing at the same time 
363 - The answer is no. Unless youre a nihilist that hates human life. Which most of these activists are. Warming of the planet will have and is having a net positive affect on total death across the globe. Far more people die of cold than heat. Not to mention the massive greening
364 - I swear I hate when people who swear they have curly hair make the products online go viral and raise the price like if they’re not expensive already
365 - Thanks mom I miss you btw. I hate living w dad

I did that because I wanted to & I'm not new to doing good deeds. Odd that people hate that.
368 - promoting the hate & division going on to keep our nation divided & fighting among each other.
369 - meow
370 - Honestly I could agree with your take if he didn’t call lgbt kids filth and flirt with anti semitism. That shit ain’t gonna fly in the suburbs. He’s gonna have to swamp Stein with natives and make genuine gains with rural Blacks to have a chance.
371 - What if I die today?
Would it teach you a lesson?
372 - Mary was a plane, traveling home away, and a little desperate, as identifiers—the Islamic symbol of the cold or you can kill
373 - 2nd night in a row.. i genuinely think my friends hate me at this point
374 - And it did nothing. 

"the ban did not appear to effect gun violence during the time it was in effect."

Further, throughout the ban there was a "steady or rising use of non-banned semiautomatics."

People who kill, will find the means to do it.

375 - Absolutely! Correct statement but not without motive! Let’s start by working together, stop this hate spewing on both sides! Stop all of the negativity and manipulation in all mediums concerning sexual orientation, and race! How about we live for America and not getting richer
376 - "struggling against AI" means you are a luddite and anti-human. Struggling against nfts is just common sense. What you actually hate is capitalism. Don't blame AI for capitalism's failings and faults.

393 - What about me? Can I? Sorry. I need a glass of water. Anyway, I agree with you. Hate sucks. We hate hate.
394 - You did that on purpose 
395 - Thank you. Appreciate your words. Key thing is getting engaged with PTA / School Boards. Children will have disagreements and fights but these religious hate must be driven out.
396 - Probably a bad take, but when Diamond Mine gets called up to the main roster, they should bring Lacey Evans into the group. I don’t like Lacey, but she would fit them well and WWE needs women tag teams.
397 - Oh no doubt. This would be a 7 game series for sure. Hate it for him and PG13

564 - all these prom and eid transitions on my fyp just solidifying how beautiful black ppl are fr
565 - You're right, I don't know if I'd qualify what they call "bully for them", but hate comments. They do receive hate (which I don't agree neither) but we know it is an infinite cycle of verbal violence.

680 - Going to the game on Sunday. Ok, forgive me, but I did buy a cute Dbacks shirt to wear to the game. I am a die hard Dodgers fan at heart though. I just love baseball so I had to go
681 - That's both wrong and disgusting. The proof is well established that gay people are not sexual predators at a higher rate than straight. 

50. Years. That's how long we've known this is a lie. Join us in reality, Qbert.
682 - Where did I hate here
683 - Quit using this man as your puppet, that's disgusting, he wouldn't have anything to do with you if he were still alive
684 - it is crazy to me, to find ppl with a RIOT GUN BUDDY, telling people to kill themselves in a valorant lobby.
685 - think about the type of people actually watching the gray man and then going on rotten tomatoes to review it. Uninteresting people who spend their lives in front of their TVs who will give a high score to any movie/show that they didn’t hate and allowed them to fill their day
686 - u just hate fun
687 - They were told to hate using lies and deception
688 - I love MST3K, but sometimes the movies they choose are so awful it hurts even when they're doing a good job riffing them. For example, I'm watching Outlaw of Gor and want everyone to die, especially the horny little Rick Moranis wannabe.
689 - PVO saying "macro level" triggers me.

His disgusting defence of Porter is not easily forgotten.

#auspol #insiders
690 - i love this movie and i will defend it till i die
691 - I can’t believe this movie is real
692 - Russ is disrespected too easily and pretty much calling him a stat padder is just hate , his points rebounds and assist are winning plays , he plays his ass off...yes he could shoot better, I will take Russ everyday on my team.....the Lakers issue wasn't him it was the fit
693 - I want to kill myself but the Charli set starts in a half hour

DP, Bertans, THJ.

699 - @liz_churchill9
 what damn POS. She's disgusting. BLOCK
700 - Say what you want about Spider-Man 3 but "never wound what you can't kill" is a hard ass line
701 - Like truly the definition of blood sweat and tears imo. And then they hate for the lost past live I feel like is unnecessary too bc outside of the fact that she was outmatched, that they all missed the point of restarting of a cycle. Like the writers were trying to make a point.
702 - this has been weighing on me real heavy this year, im genuinely afraid of going to Indy’s event because yknow, a lot of hoosiers love their guns and hate minorities
703 - ngl y’all, i’m nervous about this upcoming pride month. i have a really bad feeling.
704 - I can be both, just like you can think I'm mentally ill and not hate me. 

as long as you don't hate people for who they are (unless it's nazis or landlords) then that's okay. you're entitled to your own opinions and stuff.
705 - Why do we need them seriously 
Just to make Albo look good to the rest of the world and continue as the lapdog for the most disgusting war mongering country on the planet!
China doesn't even need military action in this region to cripple us!
706 - Sad. So much hate for no reason, but whatever
707 - Were you ranting about Alito Thomas or both as you do hate Thomas. That is not a Republican thing. That is a you wasted days attacking him thing. BTW you can not be trolled when you stand on a political soapbox howling at the moon. You can and should be disagreed with...
708 - I would hope so. They’ve came after a lot of things whether it be with KC, Atlanta, florida state. The tomahawk chop is another big one I would hate if they took away
709 - A majority of Hollywood stars hate us pleabs
710 - I FEEL THIS! I also kill people with it and then forget that the AoE fire hurts and I run in to loot and then end up having to waste heals 
711 - humans they create and control. While the rest of us die off in pain and misery because they have poisoned us in a slow kill tactic. I don't know if there is too many people on this planet but I know the people running this place have fked it up severely through greed.
712 - Illegal immigrant deporter !

One of the positions available at South Africa's Home Affairs Department for the ANC. I've never in my life seen such a low salary for so many responsibilities. 

You vote for communism, you get communism.
You will run of out money every month.
713 - I just saw South Africa’s Home Affairs Department is hiring for x34 new positions (Vacancy Circulars HRMC 24, 26 & 27 OF 2023) - Click to see also ☛  https://youthopportunitieshub.com/south-africas-home-affairs-department-is-hiring-for-x34-new-positions/…
714 - Why do people act like it was only bron fans talking ish about westbrook lol people were calling him westbrick as far back as 2012, the hate russ has gotten isn’t something that just appeared this year
715 - don’t take my word for it but I think it’s an hour from now ?
716 - Hopefully...
Why don't you all just leave her alone.. You all act like you hate bullies but you're exactly that, a mob of bullies feeding off your healthy hatred of a person you don't even know personally. It's disgusting 
717 - You know what else is embarrassing? People who obsess over Michael Flynn like he's their messiah, people who have sold their brains to DJT, and people who hate other people because of their ancestors, religion or skin tone. I've seen your page--you are the one who hates America.
718 - I remain sceptical about this, since it is so new and people try to weaponize and exploit the topic.
In my opinion changing this system this way is a win for equality. I don't know why people are upset about it.
They use the service but hate it at the same time. Its weird.
719 - Life is short. One day, we will all die. No more shame, no more fear, no more anger. Some people wanna get there faster. I say, it's inevitable anyway why rush it

Look forward to your eternal rest after a life well lived.

Life is meant to be SPENT, used, enjoyed thoroughly.
720 - It's funny how Democrats don't want to die so that a handful of corporations can turn a profit. Then they buy Republicans with some of those profits.

740 - This is such a brutal way to lose. You absolutely hate to see it
741 - NHL: Wow, what a win for the Vegas Golden Knights; just tremendous to be able to bounce back from conceding the tying goal late. 

Advantage Vegas, who go up 2-1 in the series. 

Michael Amadio is the OT villain in Winnipeg.

778 - I had a guy do that years ago: he went OFFFFF when he bought dinner (after I said it wasn’t a date and I’d pay my way). I hate how common this shit is
779 - Twitter is a disgusting app. Treat people with fucking human decency. People literally be minding their business and loving themselves just to be bullied and harassed. Shit is wicked and sick
780 - With colors is way better
781 - Everyone has their faults.
Look on the bright side!!  They don't rub grown men's asses in the faces of children and kill inconvenient infants that breathe or try to normalize incest.
782 - If you’re going to Staples tonight have fun! (I hate you)
783 - What about them? She can praise and uplift anyone she chooses! Hate is like cancer and it will one day destroy you.

791 - i hate ppl
792 - Jumping on the hate Meghan bandwagon once again, without facts, just goes to show what and lies, you and your colleagues actually spread around.
793 - Also idk why people expected Aang to be a 5-star father when at only 10 he was dealing with survivors guilt, the genocide of his people, those responsible hunting him, and his closest friends expecting him to kill Ozai. There's a lot he didn't get a chance to unpack
794 - i hate recycling
795 - The fact that this tweet exists and has so many likes just shows niggas hate on Korra just do it because Aang definitely got captured like 4 or 5 different times
796 - Aang wouldn’t have gotten caught like let’s start there twitter.com/korysverse/sta…
797 - Interesting story. Germany is very weird. I can understand why people have question marks on their faces. We're at the peak of madness right now with Die Grünen. I'm glad I can choose how much of it I want in my life.
798 - And I love Korra and a lot of hate she gets boils down to her being a woman but comparing someone who trained her whole life to a 10 yr old is insulting to her imo
799 - I thought they never confirmed what engine they were using? From what I understand we still don’t know what engine is being used for FF16, it’s not UE5 or Luminous engine. FF7 ReBirth will be using UE5.

804 - They are and i hate that i can't blame them cuz they're special needs but i was about to put my hands on his dad
805 - Korra vs Aang discourse is so goofy like they're different people who went through wholly different things and were raised different ways and y'all shitting on a 10 yr old who only had one year to learn everything and had all his friends expecting his pacifist ass to kill a man
806 - What are you talking about your trying to argue for someone who sits on his arse streaming his reactions to games who just spreads hate on the players, everyone needs to realise that he isn’t liked by match goers for a reason
807 - I’ve been struggling with a heart condition called #pericarditis for two months now. I hate talking about serious things (ew) but because there is so little information out there about the recovery process maybe Twitter can help. Please share anything you know  #HeartDisease

That speaker guy is some kind of guru.

819 - Jrue Holiday is my kind of player hate playing against him lol
820 - Love aang but let's not over hype the lil man. He's always got the business from master benders until he hits his avatar state. Which would've been a problem since they know the objective is to kill while in the avatar state
821 - Congrats, now your nahida can kill nilou/yelan/zhongli mains in coop
822 - That's not an argument. People hate the NRA because their goal is to sell guns to as many people as possible, regardless of the power of the gun or the intent (school shooters)
823 - — to do, especially when Danzō is a threat. However, once Sasuke-san killed Danzō, the mark on Sai-san was gone.”

She took another deep breath.

“It’s possible he may kill Sasuke-san for vengeance, and he might use Sarada for his own gain as well.”

837 - I don't know how one person's dating choices invalidates other people. I know a lot of trans people choose it because of safety and because they really love other trans people. It's not like they're saying that they hate cis people. It's such a weird stance to have.
838 - You hate America. You hate children. STHU

886 - The senator called a witness who announced people were “a thousand times more likely to die from a bicycle than from COVID,” concluding, “so I think it would be appropriate that the federal government ban all bicycles because they're certainly more likely to kill you than COVID."
887 - By peace you mean letting POS scum steal and rape your women and children and kill every single civilian and then get to keep stolen Ukrainian land?!? You make me sick..

147 - https://vice.com/en/article/4wbban/have-scientists-learned-anything-from-giving-drugs-to-spiders-1029… “.. naturally occurring amounts of caffeine can kill animals that need a hormone called octopamine—a category that includes spiders, but not humans. That might help explain why caffeine devastates spider web production.”
148 - You serious? Because these are your policies… pronouns, critical race theory, reparations… you know republicans are not in charge, it’s Dems who care about everything except those 85 thousand misplaced immigrant kids…
149 - No, you all are putting hobbies over childrens lives. Evil and disgusting.
150 - You misunderstand on purpose j swear, democrats don’t want abortions because they want to kill babies, republicans don’t want guns so they can kill children. Why are you having trouble understanding my point?
151 - Those are the real questions...why is this mostly an American problem? What kind of person daydreams for months and then actually points a gun at a child, innocent random stranger etc and wants to kill as many as possible? We need to dissect this issue and figure it out

157 - Here is your disconnect; all laws in the world, historically have their origins in religious values. I.e., “thou shall not kill.” Pretty basic, right? But you argue that the acceptance of a set of values is the declaration that all others are void.
158 - Criminals won’t go through background checks and waiting periods, much less psychological testing. Regular people will. Make it harder to get a gun than a drivers license or cough medicine. No one’s rights will be infringed unless you’re a criminal who wants to kill people.

184 - So, you are telling me that killing a child is acceptable if you do not love the child? I am not forcing anyone to "love" a child. I am simply against allowing them to kill a child because they do not love it. At 8 weeks it is a human being, and killing it is murder.

215 - It’s the fucking people. Especially liberals justifying and martyring the killers…like Hollywood and

330 - Disgusting by Chase.  A good knockdown but ruined any opportunity to end it properly by hitting him when down.  Stevie likely would have got back up and then been there for the taking, but he did that low shit instead.  Shouldn't be allowed in a ring again for a while

547 - haven’t been to the gym in a week I’m DISGUSTING

583 - It doesn’t make it wrong either  that’s his work nothing is free in this society, not even the most basic things a human needs . That’s why he (in the mv) killed someone with chopsticks, “we kill to eat and we eat to survive”

603 - 19. Views on friends who date their best friend's exes?
604 - Yea bc banning gender affirming care, which reduces suicide rates by 42% isn’t trying to kill trans people. Or florida and texas putting forward bills that allow the state to take trans kids away from supportive families.
605 - What would you call it?  The gun is made to kill people, a lot of people in a short amount of time.  It is useless as a hunting rifle it tears the body apart.  Maybe congress should have gone to Uvalde to see children blown apart.  2nd amendment my ass.
606 - Spent the past few hours speaking to Naomi and Faling. They kill me

@RoyalFamily

@KensingtonRoyal
 must remove that MBE nonsense she bangs on about. She is a national disgrace to the very fabric of this Country. She would have advocated for the death of Gay people in the Military. Likes of her are the reason we lost Turing!
609 - Putting this out again so any politician or trans activist checking out my tweets can see it… this was just in 24hrs. This is how people feel about fair sport for females here in the Uk (&around the world). Safe, fair then inclusive in that order. Female/Open no one left out
610 - Great kill!
611 - Most of the comments are fucked up and this is the world and society we exist in, guessing it would be different if it was your family probably not since the only thing we know is kill, steal, then kill some more.

639 - yeah it’s disgusting and sickening
640 - AMD IM LOSING
641 - What if I told you the words Legal and Immigrant are not mutually exclusive? There is absolutely nothing wrong with preventing those who entered the country illegally from obtaining both gainful employment and public assistance. Send. Them. Home.

662 - Forcing anyone to fight for Raytheon, Halliburton, and 6 million Jews is the most disgusting proposal one could make. 

America is not worth fighting for in its current state.
663 - One of the reasons why I'm so in favor of a draft is that by forcing young people to endure physical hardships, and compelling them to learn leadership and discipline, you automatically wring all the soy and corruption out of their bodies that modern society injects into them.
664 - Now look up how they treat refugees and what it is they do to dogs.

672 - Good because the death penalty means another human has to kill someone, and not in a state of self defense. Especially when some in law enforcement have broken morals & rules to put some people in jail or worse on death row. Best we be on the safe side.
673 - It's official. The death penalty is no longer in state law. In 2014 I issued a moratorium. In 2018 the state Supreme Court deemed the death penalty unconstitutional. Now in 2023, passage of SB 5087 strikes it entirely from our statutes.

685 - Policing has always been a racialized system. Today's police depts evolved from slave patrols. And throughout this country's history, police have always been used as a weapon of the state to harass, abuse and kill Black people. Even today it's doing what it was designed to do.
686 - Can i not feel fucking bad for all of them? All of this is shit and all of it just shows how awful humanity is, you all kill each other, you all support cruelty and ideological purity and psychopathic dictators and evil- is there really nothing better then what we have before us?

688 - it isn't though, at the very best Jesus might've existed and that's it, not as a son of god but most likely a mentally unwell man.  Religion is meant to be a way of life and when that way of life gives the description of how you should kill gay people then yeah

700 - You kill human life.   Filthy

1 - He is too weak for english football, he needs to toughen up run more and make his pass accuracy and vision better
2 - What are your thoughts on Fábio Vieira?
3 - God gave them the best and worst power in the world, they have a very deadly bite but they have such a weak mouth that you can close it with your bear hands
4 - So it means that the fact that a child can't be conceived is a pretty weak reason to oppose gay marriage when the main dude in the whole religion wasn't even conceived by a married couple
5 - The holding call was weak. The hooking call was the right call. You can’t have your stick up on the hands of the opponent like that…. It’s text book hooking
6 - I asked what your biggest challenge was since leaving… you can’t answer… weak minded…
7 - Ahh, I apologize. I didn't realize you're still learning English. 

Emigre typically refers to someone who's fled a country for specific political reasons. Usually, these people are high class + families or ex-military. 

Otherwise, refugees or just "immigrants" is best

12 - im abt to do my first ever pilates class wish me luck !!!!???? im scared and also so so weak
13 - Ron Hamilton's "Rejoice in the Lord" is one of my favorite songs.

14 - weak as hell!!!!!
15 - I think I got food poisoning from eating that weak ass Burger King
16 - The only fabrication i see is this weak ass statement. He is a r*pist

24 - This is so weak
25 - It’s those weak bars think she dissing for me 
26 - I mean, you do admit that is your opinion, which you are free to have, but the "PAC is a weak conference" narrative, I fully admit, was true in 2021, but not so much in 2022. The PAC last season was arguably one of the deepest with six top 20 teams at seasons end.
27 - Weak judgement he doesn't deserve Bail, he needs to held till Court hearing ...he's a Killer & must be treated as such, he's weapon of choice was a Car so why in Gods name let he walk free, get a back bone Judge No privalages, No special treatment
28 - His triggering tactics are working . He’s pissing off the weak minded so bad that they are flocking to truth to yell at him .
29 - OK. I'll say it this way:

There's no good evidence for your god. The evidence compiled thus far is weak and unconvincing.
30 - If it's happy: Raon watched Spiderman, curious & try the kiss 

If it's sad: Raon/Wuju kiss while the other was weak or unconscious, or as a goodbye kiss (can't help thinking the crease near the left person's eyes could be tears )

#500KWujuBakeryPilot 
#JeffBarcodeWujuBakery
31 - With this sketch of the kissing scene, what do you think is the scenario leading to the kiss? 

I think it would be like Wuju stealing a kiss from Raon when Raon was lying on bed  and that’s the mmt Raon learns about “kiss” 

#500KWujuBakeryPilot 
#JeffBarcodeWujuBakery
32 - Weak eastern conference doesn’t move me and they weren’t winning a champ which is what succes is. Anyway besides your example, explain to me why kyrie can’t succes when being first option? Surely being that skilled should help…

53 - To be fair, he's between feedings.

He's due to get a fresh infusion of immigrant child blood during the summer solstice before entering the Dark Slumber.

Then, the legends say, he'll wait in the cold ground until the fresh life of spring lures him out to feast again.

58 - There is no doubt—this is NOT even close - Alive! Without Alive, there’d be no KISS, no Destroyer, no R&R Over or Love Gun or Alive II or Dynasty etc. Without Alive, the 4th album is called Monster and is as weak as Dressed, Casablanca goes under, KISS disbands : the End

As Muslims celebrate Eid, security & humanitarian sources told @AFP army intelligence has been cracking down on Syrians, deporting dozens to the war-torn country in past weeks -- incl an army defector!

His sobbing relative said "his life is at risk".
73 - Oh damn! The NYTs is crying, in public! Poor baby, lost your press conference! Go do some damn journalism and stop sitting around waiting for a press conference. How many immigrant came through the Darien Gap today? How much money was stolen via cryptocurrency today?

97 - This is exactly what happens when you raise men to act like bitches. 

Her man ran away, luckily she did not get hurt. Other women aren’t so lucky.

108 - What is the manipulation behind crying i mean if you cry for no reason and need a day to just cry your not right something bad has had to happen to cry not just a mood boosting feeling because I don’t accept it and find you to be weak

114 - He said she never suffered bullying irl and that she was weak. Repeatedly downplaying the trogs bullying her while magnifying her supposed weakness because she didn't want to deal with the weeks of harassment that followed an announcement to play a game.

That's out of line.
115 - 1. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 gave the Federal Reserve authority to set monetary policy in the United States.

191 - And they realize, more importantly, that the “adults” they always depended on are feckless and weak. The youth will stand together, i with them, and we will hear their roar of outrage, screams and in one voice they will change our world for good.

"I think it's pretty straightforward, Keiji."

"You can't be a father just because the mood strikes you, Myaa-sam."

Osamu bristled and Akaashi shifted in his seat, each of them seeking and probing for a weak spot.
207 - Communists hated themselves enough to slaughter each other like animals. Whole USSR history is a story of internal purges between themselves. Your argument is weak and doesn't prove a single thing.

222 - Now that I'm thinking about it, this is the same issue I have with "Strong men create good times, good times create weak men, etc..."

Like...what do y'all even MEAN by "strong" vs "weak" men???  Cause I don't THINK you mean physical strength but if you do...what?????
223 - Every time I see this tweet, I instantly become confused on what we're defining as "weak men" and "strong men".  Cause I'm pretty sure physical strength doesn't determine whether or not a dudes an asshole

421 - ALSO #SPX never hit 6000 but is has hit 4200 multiple times…so this is not a vapor number - problem is most are looking for any opportunity to take shorts (with a weak #DXY you lose on the dollar value of the trade and then the actual short) very few people are actually buying…

450 - This 6ft 1 biological man is leading a campaign to push an amendment to Title IX to allow biological boys into girls sports across all schools. 

Lia Thomas, who ranked #554 competing against men, and #1 in a Women’s race doesn’t believe trans people have any unfair advantage.
451 - Such weak.
452 - Weak ass killer.
453 - Austin Slater is a valuable complimentary player (like 4th or 5th OF and RH bat off the bench) for a contending team.  He is a guy that can help. But, if he is getting more than about 250 at bats, he is on a weak roster.  Just one guys opinion.
454 - Republicans are about to see these young weak people - kick some a$$

469 - “Gruesome” and “Suffering” are purely human emotions. Animals fight for survival and do not have the time or brain power to waste on human emotions. It is a vicious world where you live or die. It is interesting to see what an emotional and weak species humans have become.
470 - Not as much as we want Fox News anchors weak,poor, frightened and alone.

474 - Nothing weak about apologizing when you realise you are in the  wrong. It shows weakness if you apologize just because the other person expects you to even when you know you did nothing wrong. Not apologizing can build resentment in a relationship too.
475 - No matter how wrong or inlove you might be never say sorry gents. It screams desperation and weakness we as ladies love guys who don't Care nor show their love. Simp and we cheat twitter.com/brian___jethro…

487 - I think the writers are working towards a female rebel or revolution guided by Seyran. And still don’t know how, also, I can’t understand Suna I feel that she likes the situation wearing that jerk ring everywhere. Why did she meet Abi with the ring? Stupid, naive, weak suna
488 - i’m so weak when it comes to you
489 - Every time I see this tweet, I instantly become confused on what we're defining as "weak men" and "strong men".  Cause I'm pretty sure physical strength doesn't determine whether or not a dudes an asshole 
490 - I'm dumping Dems 4 this as a Woman, Immigrant.
Dems HAVE NOT considered or mentioned any women's views in Title IX amendment. 

GIRLS lack access to sports- There r 1M more boys in sports, sports choices,spots, sponsorships.Junior, elite, amateur

Why r U not listening to women?
491 - I think I need to watch documentary and ask illegal immegrants from Mexico how they live.

493 - Don’t you live how racist Dems think immigrants are only smart enough to pick fruit and clean houses? My legal immigrant husband is a USMC LtCol. Illegals should have no jobs in America.

497 - Weak union

499 - SO. WHOLESOME.  We loved every minute of the first ep. of No Borders Just Flavors. 
@UNITEDWEDREAM

500 - This what happened when America give out citizenship like candy
Black American are the only ethnic group that did not immigrant here we was human traffick
501 - They jump the weak mfs 
502 - No, I don't. Bc my mind doesn't function that way. Even if Biden was weak by appearance, that's in front of me, and it's confirmed by his policies. The policies are the determining factor for me. If, let's say, Biden had Trump's policies, I wouldn't be as concerned as I am now.
503 - they some bitches too
504 - I don't know where I fall here... I'm cis/het, but I'm demi? So I don't know if I'm an ally or part of the group.

I agree that genocide isn't too strong a word. Shits getting scarier. We need to be ready to protect queer refugees from these states.
505 - I mean, when the youth are a bunch of bird-chested dweebs with nose rings who are more preoccupied with pronouns than being a cohesive fighting unit then yeah, you're going to have a weak military.

524 - I'm praying for strength in your spirit and your body. Don't let the devil win. He likes to attack when we're weak. But it's. Your Prayer warriors are covering you. 
You belong to GOD!
PLEASE KEEP US UPDATED!
525 - weak nair power geyser is absolutely a jumpscare
526 - Being the child of a British-Jamaican immigrant and a Black American, the diaspora wars just get so old… cus like I hear them in the house. 
527 - Weak Congi reply 
Mouni Singh was a wooden puppet, treated very disrespectfully by Rajmata and Pappu. Don’t pretend Rishi or BJP is insulting him.
528 - The champagne is a brilliant idea! We will still watch and read your stuff!
529 - Weak mentality just like last season
530 - Arsenal have dropped points in their last three Premier League games.

Will it cost them the title? 
531 - I got you my Canadian homie.
No mercy. 

And both our countries dealing with WEAK COMPLACENT LEADERS.
532 - Having natural hair is not for the weak lol I been blowing drying my hair for hours
533 - This is fact?..."Jefferson fooled casuals by over preforming against weak teams all year, with the season on the line it’s Watson who stepped up."... This opioid crisis is gettin outta hand.
534 - She’s not as weak of a singer as yall make her out to be . Storytelling is her strongest but she’s alright with singing. And as for her acting , better than being a Jack of all trades master at none. Being strong musically and theatrically is rare.
535 - I told y'all you call yourself African American you put your self in the immigrant class
Black American are not immigrants
536 - You do realize we are both immigrants right?
537 - Fabio Vieira has never helped arsenal. The guy is always lost and clueless, weak and lost. He cant pass, can't shoot, can't tackle, can't intercept. The guy is probably the most inept player in this squad. An U9 player could do better. Sell this clown

541 - really wish every state would, alphabet agencies would are too weak alone
542 - https://twitter.com/OBEhizele/status/1600414862252789760…

The problem is that most Nationalists struggle to coherently articulate this point. I think because they are coming from a place of frustration, anger and 'hate' at times (still a weak excuse). However, it taints their ability to relate this argument.
543 - Cultural conservatism. I appreciate the diversity of cultures. How culture reflects in architecture, food etc. I do think many on 'the right' struggle to articulate this viewpoint (they end up delving into ethno-nationalism). Thus, why it's easily dismissed.
544 - Pull out game as weak as your parenting skills
545 - Weak
546 - I am weak!!!!! “I’m sorry!” “You ain’t sorry bitch!” 
547 - I can name five, but I listen to great rappers, not street niggas with weak mic skillz. Him pinking Freddie Gibbs gave him some false confidence.

Fucking wish version of Tony yayo
548 - Who let that immigrant in anyway?
549 - for when i am weak, then i am strong

553 - People forget Kamala and Biden fought.
554 - I saw fighter jets, columns of apcs and trucks. They chased UA cars in civil and let look like Ukrainians as the invaders. They checked us on the boarder intensely wich was very uncommon before. On the boarder intself also had army personal. They know that only came refugees…
555 - Weak
556 - “I beg your pardon” got me weak 
557 - This combined with scouting report metrics says to me that Bryce Young is in a class by himself, and after that it's a pretty weak QB class. Disappointing to see Stroud and Hooker score so low, but surprising to see Levis so high.
558 - Weak.  Still with the “open border” narrative? Lol sure bud. Next time there is a massive seizure of fentanyl keep your mouth shut. 

GD it everyone hates you.
559 - No weak auras yo. Only stronk auras!
560 - It is really sad that weak minds want to make any issue political.
561 - The reepz project is a small community of like minded collectors who appreciate art as well as a quick flip. We do not sell shame, put others down or any of that weak shit. We build together and we can all win, trust me.  If you fuck with that then join the club.
562 - So you’re assuming then, are you an AI with facial recognition that can determine the gender? Otherwise it’s a pretty weak argument. Also - if she didn’t do anything to you, why is she dangerous?
563 - Markets Update

We had all the chances to close the wk above the SPX 4150-4200 supply ceiling.. Instead, weak price action is what we got *think Erectile Disfunction* (same as Feb & Fall ‘22)  

Weekly close was bearish on SPX & Dow for a 2nd wk, NQ for the 3rd wk…
564 - See ya, has been.

Don’t get a red ass when you come back and get slagged for being a typical weak-kneed liberal.

579 - Rudeness is the weak person’s imitation of strength
580 - I like strong coffee and weak tea
581 - The Afghanistan debacle made us look so weak and inept, it encouraged many countries to turn from us. most prominently Saudi Arabia. You know the country we helped fund the genocide of Yemen. (Another Obama beauty). Which is why Putin thought he could get away with it. And he did
582 - The weak died off like they supposed to
583 - I also suspect it encapsulates why today’s Conservative Party is so weak among its former base: professional/managerial classes. Anyone who runs a business, public body, or professional firm knows how fatal bullying is to effective service delivery.
584 - This tweet encapsulates what's wrong with (parts of) today's Conservative Party. It's clearly untrue (if it were true, all ministers would currently be subject to accusations of bullying) and worse the intent is to undermine confidence in one of our key institutions twitter.com/joymorrissey/s…

590 - It’s clear here in the USA that gynocentrism is the source of the issues. The weak now control the strong. FACTS! As a result the strong will disappear. No wonder our marriage rates are low and divorce rates high. It’s obvious, but men are too SCARED to admit it.
591 - Pure exploitation and many don’t have unions & also won’t speak up bc they are afraid

596 - No, we all know a bully when we encounter one.  They are incompetent weak cowards.
597 - I'd like to introduce you to my friend Bill. Bill lives in Hungary and since March of last year has been fundraising and personally delivering aid to Ukrainian refugees. At first to nearby Kisgorbo Hungary and most recently to Dnipro where he has been making regular trips. 1/

599 - Other women act too prideful to beg for a man back but then there's me
600 - I'm pro-democracy, anti-fascism, pro LBTQ+, pro refugees. I'm against lies and liars. I'm against fascist, hate-mongering Tories who've impoverished and divided my country for their greed. I'm for facts and against bogus culture wars used to deflect from government corruption.
601 - "Mommy game strong?" Mommy game weak as a newborn deers knees in spring at a Walmart parking lot, especially with that behavior. LIKE you really thought you ate with taking away someone else's privacy just to get a power trip and start dancing like a clown for to the world to see
602 - Be nice to be amused at the current shitshow. Sadly no amusement at a complete and open breakdown of actual leadership. Weak at best but all sticking to party directives. Pity those directives appear to be not on original mandate? Meow is not a political or diplomatic term.
603 - Yeahh I'll one shot everything lol until ar20 After that i think my characters are getting weak lol

Not that they'd need help looking ridiculous. Just show them a rainbow and they turn into sad little puddles of whine.

....while complaining it's *others* that make the US look weak.

I wish I made it up, but alas.
611 - Just saw some people unironically saying Senator Armstrong was right, did y'all forget about the whole purging the weak bit??
612 - Right..The whole play and momentum died on his stick in the offensive zone when he decided to skate in deep like he was Bobby Orr than coughed up the puck to a weak hit and didn't even battle to get it back. Holl defenders are tiring
613 - But what are we going to do since all your efforts to save us have been even more pathetic and weak? Sorry did I say save us? I meant divide
614 - So weak
615 - This depends

If someone has put their identity, ego, or self validation into a view or stand, their ability to change at that point depends on their strength as a person

Weak people with fragile ego's, cannot change

Strong confident people with steadfast self-worth can.
616 - You apologies are like you Price weak and very Right Wing you have aligned yourself with the very enemies like DUTTON etc, of First Nation Australians! Have you No Shame?
617 - In Aug 2020, Jacinta Price had to apologise to Nova Peris as part of a Studio 10 defamation settlement

Price apologised for her heinous comments accusing fmr Senator Nova Peris of protecting sexual predators

That's how low Price was prepared to go

618 - And yet they perform gender reassignment surgery for an immigrant? 
This is a tragic tale. They want him to die.
619 - Actually @carolinewnz, as a taxpayer it is my business and the same goes for others that might ask.  Are we paying for new immigrants to have their bodies mutilated when this poor soul is still waiting for a hip replacement?

158 - Agree. 

What I also don't understand is why, if a brand wants to uplift trans people and further trans rights, they don't choose a trans person who is actually impressive...smart, self-confident, genuine, comfortable in their own skin.

Dylan Mulvaney seems none of these.

193 - 90% of my clients are regulars and 90% of them have stuck with me for years. It's a nice feeling. It's a certain personality type who is more into quality than variety. I enjoy people like that,  because I associate it with stability which is something I find very sexy in a man.
194 - Activist? That's a funny way to spell act of domestic terror. I just love how these "activists" can go around wherever they want, cause bodily harm and even death and you got the left wing nut jobs praising them. Life in prison or death penalty fits better.

208 - I love seeing them off devices. Pst.. The girls may like that. 
Live in the now.. When ya can.
209 - Moral of the story: the reason why most Indian/South Asian teams (even the top ones) will almost never make it far in any FPS title is because of their "happy to be here" and "happy to be signed" mentality.

Get better, or you will fall behind soon.
210 - I love when taeyeon takes picture from this angle she knows she's hot

814 - It’s probably not being covered because it only makes the news if they can somehow make the shooter either racist of the victim. We both know it’s all about rating and pushing your false agenda. Guns only kill people when they’re in the wrong hands. Focus on the wrong hands.

2 - COME SEE ME GET THESE OW COMP DUBS !!
3 - Watching Gladwell try to influence the crowd with his reminder of his roots was pathetic, so was his ploy to try to garner sympathy. Go back to New York, shithead. Far be it from me to keep you from seeing the hole debate. See the loser for yourself.

11 - I was a really scared and anxious kid (like REALLY anxious) and your drawings of Jeff being a goofy loser were the highest form of comedy (and comfort, weirdly enough) to younger me. Thanks for giving me my first comfort character (even tho it was a strange one LMAO)
12 - Sorry, SAN Jacinto. Literally fat fingered.
13 - getting caught up in your image online to give you value and treating yourself like trash because you made something ugly in the process of learning will only make things harder. if your intention with a sketchbook is to use it to learn, make ugly art and don’t rip out pages
14 - lol these ‘Men. Do Not…’ RTs are annoying AF especially from the gays. yeah I said it.
15 - Republicans are the ones who are using the LGBTQ+ community as a boogeyman. You're demonizing them to earn points with and energize your racist, homophobic, child genitalia-obsessed MAGA base.
16 - Would be funnier if the background music playing while Squidward is crying is “I’m (Not) A Loser” from the musical
17 - The male contestant are beyond ugly
18 - Nah its ugly fr fr
19 - this fat horny fuck
20 - Why would he be appreciated?  The man was a complete failure.  He walked into office with total control with Congress and walked out losing everything.  As he would say,  he's a complete loser.
21 - Commban for telling a sore loser that is crying in a message after they lost- to “stfu” is commban worthy? Wtf pussified world do we live in!?
Or is it calling someone a “loser”?

25 - Trump will go down in history as more the loser than the winner.
26 - Nope i also have a boat but i choose to sail in it. Not sleep in it. You sleeping in a boat is your kick to society that you dont want to pay your way in life. I would of admired that if you didnt stand up for fat nonces. You can have morals and live a peaceful life.
27 - And so my interests werent in police/racial/current politics and my lack of concern even disdain and derision for "End of the World" nonsense of fear inducing TV preachers and Hal Lindsay types was influenced by my Catholic religious childhood and my reaction to non Cath prosely
28 - It's laggy bugged and annoying like the other 20 times you put this event live!
29 - They have no conscience, no memory and are capable only of hive thinking. They are The Borg.

33 - @meilizzz_
 I cannot believe that you are hating on Harbor like this. He is objectively one of the best looking agents in the game with his sexy beard. The only reason for this could be racial motivation. #cancelled
34 - This is the very reason Biden steered his administration and the party away from accountability for Trump and his J6 co-conspirators, and away from legislation to defend our democracy moving forward. He wanted to guarantee himself a rematch against a loser. Deeply selfish person.
35 - Check the Ugly “Whore” with Rotten Teeth 
36 - جاتی امراء میں ٹکٹس لینے کے لئے کیوں نئی تھے لوگ یا آپ لوگ یہ سہولت گھر بیٹھے مہیا کر رہے ہوں گھر گھر جا کر ترلے کر رہے ہو کہ ٹکٹس لے لو کیوں میڈم جی ایسا ہی ہے آپ کے ٹویٹس سے ایک با تو واضح ہوئی کہ خان کے ٹکٹس کے لئے لوگ مر رہے ہیں
37 - Don’t blame him. Kittens are usually extremely annoying!
38 - Just this WEEK, Oklahoma LAWMAKERS we’re outed pining for the good ol days of unpunished lynchings.

What do you think systemic racism IS? How are Black Oklahomans supposed to trust anything those LAWMAKERS ever said about racial equality that’s (allegedly) the law of the land?
39 - What the fuck is racial equity?
Crime have nothing to do with race.
No such thing as "Crime of poverty".
40 - if you don't shop at Trader Joe's you are a low IQ low class loser
41 - If you ever want a quick lesson on Structural Racism and Food Insecurity, just do a quick Maps lookup of Trader Joe’s in Los Angeles.
42 - I was thinking the same thing
43 - I'll do it to you just for being annoying over it
44 - nah im so fucking dead, the only thing i have done lately is this shit (and i fucking love it)

62 - If anyone watching my page for a friend tell her I said she ugly
63 - WAIT YALL GOT RO SEE A TURTLE WTF
64 - Confidence in ugly guys is overconfidence. Simple as that. People hate it because its not what they expect. It defies us learning our place as guttertrash. Tryna be shit or thinking we're worth shit goes against the social status quo. It unnerves them. They have no respect for it
65 - Thats right the fat old man with the alcoholic red tint is throwing stones at someone’s looks.

78 - Imagine spending $8/month so Elon will pay attention to your loser ass.

80 - We get rich we get fat 
81 - i think you might be exercising too much, probably from all the traveling. this probably sounds dumb but try adding more fat and protein to your diet!! but not too quickly tho, eating too many cals in a short period of time can lead to heart attack

91 - Like i only started sayin she was ugly to piss yall off more  u needa learn to read more instead of lashing out at me over my race ur trynna justify ur racism when i never even said that shit in the first place
92 - What's really annoying? When people talk about their social skills as if they worked for it. Shelly, you were born with it. Having full on conversations by 4. You don't even remember. So don't criticize others who have to work for it and some brains aren't wired that way.
93 - Really wanna eat a banana rn         fat mindset

892 - Lmao, you guys love giving your money to so called “billionaires”. Loser behavior haha
893 - I play you’re game 8 hours a day like a loser. It’s so good and I’m addicted already. Just need some netcode fixing because the desync of players is pretty bad but every thing else is great. Thanks for finally creating a game that I enjoy Since fortnite
894 - I thought the same. I was so disappointed. They were waaaay too gracious towards this loser.
895 - Loser
896 - Loser
897 - I'm 59, white & conservative. I am not told by any one  how to think. At 84 we can't be sure this man isn't mentally impaired, but if u try to enter a stranger's home, you are in danger of violence. The claim this was racial is baseless. More lies from the race baiters.
898 - Movement in apex is annoying. It feels like your playing against characters that all did a massive line of coke before the match. It’s like a tweaker fest.
899 - The fat boyz are back
900 - You’re the product on Twitter. Now you’re paying to be the product. Loser.
901 - Fat pig wont cut itself
902 - You see that in Seson 3 with Colleen… it was coming off desperate how she kept going from guy to guy in th woods professing she loved them and then 2 denied her and she just basically picked someone smh
903 - What an absolute loser 
904 - Whoever thought it was a brilliant idea to add in sound on VSCode whenever you’re typing needs to be FIRED!! 

Cannot emphasise enough how annoying that sound is when you’re trying to work.
905 - I don't understand the #Democrats not voting to protect #WomensSports. The cry constantly about abolishing the #Patriarchy but apparently they are #Subservient  to the #QueerPatriarchy putting on #WomanFace to take rights away from Biological Women. #TitleIX #LiaThomas=#WomanFace
906 - Umm, because he's NONE OF THOSE THINGS, you pathetic has been LOSER...
907 - Not a terrible idea, although you do run into issues regarding what Wikipedia views as significant.  And I do find the lack of verification on accounts that are public figures (e.g. members of Congress) annoying.
908 - OPINION: Twitter should consider offering Twitter Blue to users who are notable enough to have a Wikipedia.

Not just limited to 3 users.
909 - I thought everyone was playing 5-D chess now a days. Dump is a loser yet again.
910 - Finally jumped on to finish out the seasonal story this week. Audio bugs were so annoying I immediately turn Destiny off after the mission.
911 - Close Barn. Only 11 strokes off. Cart path only isn’t  good for this fat guy.
912 - these ugly bitches is really boosting my ego
913 - Even though messi, mbappe & neymar hasn't worked under any manager, Poch made them terribly worse between he & Galtier...
   He led Spurs to all those with no trophy to show, that just means he's a Loser with a Loser mentality 
914 - disgusting nasty gross... omfg you need a disclaimer, you should not be showing this nasty fat ass without it..
915 - Lmao nice try loser
916 - never wanted to see you in my tl anyway loser
917 - #Snowflake 
@dbongino
 is so desperate for recognition and respect that he feels the need to go "nah, nah."
Just proves the weak loser he is.
Are you going to cry when Trump, et al, get indicted in #Georgia?
Maybe then 
@FoxNews
 will stoop to letting you back on air for a moment.
918 - Americans finding out theyre 1/10000th irish and making jokes abt the famine/the troubles its so fucking ANNOYING
919 - my mom tells me to do things as if I’m incompetent and it’s so annoying 
920 - Super ugly wow.
921 - The fandomification copypasta going around is kind of annoying but it did remind me that pal often gets delegated to giving g/h advice in fic. Which usually happens with women and m/m ships. So this reversal is hilarious to me and I support it even if it is a little repetitive
922 - I'm pretty sure it was Bowser's fault for Peach being overstimulated here.  He was being a sore loser.
923 - Disgusting fat thing
924 - cucked out loser NoiseTank what a guy
925 - omggg i love them sm!!! I saw that, mine is kinda the same but i saw this girl i wanted to know if anyone else has experience with that. I couldn’t tell if it’s just some ppls bone structure or just fat

928 - Not at all.
929 - We’ll one thing it definitely was was annoying; that’s for sure!
930 - She's just a sore loser. Waaagh. #MeghanMarkleisaLiar  #MeghanMarkleIsAGrifter

3: She wants pink lips, not red.

46 - What I find funny is you and the few other people haven’t said anything but… 

1- calling me a “pick me”
2- correcting my English (which is weak)
3- You yourself only asking “sources”? And then “is that your only source”? Not giving anything to the conversation. It seems
47 - Please who can bring that post or picture of a Yoruba mother of twins that was sentenced to death by hanging in Saudi Arabia for drug trafficking?
48 -  No, what this season of Picard proves is that we need good writers and show runners who care more about telling a good story than any of what you’re talking about here. Fan reaction and viewership numbers make this perfectly clear.
49 - 1024 got shooters we doomed fine they provide updates but why they always faster than kq — how do you not realize it’s a different level of hating to be mad that an update account is good at updating  half the time they put wh…
50 - TBS. Got to watch the Braves all the time and family did too
51 - And just a good boy that dindu nothin, right?  If there was anyone saying it was a lone white shooter it would be everywhere. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it. The media would post a racially motivated spree like this everywhere.

53 - …so good
54 - good job! but i were to feedback just from looking at the .gif u posted >> i would never go read a lengthier explanation for a shorter code snippet .. u'd notice that a most highest answers in StackOverflow r shorter ones (if lengthy, so that cuz they TLDR after going short)

56 - @netflix
 we want to watch the show!!
57 - someone. Lilia's an interesting fella. Being of royal status really can be a drag. Best we enjoy our freedom while we can right? Be all gone in a blink of an eye.

Don't worry too much about being as good as her. You'll grey before your...... 500 or somethin' stressing."
58 - Good night Jenny, have a blessed night’s sleep and sweet 
@ErikEstrada
 dream’s my dear friend  
@Jenny79217656
 @ErikEstrada
59 - Judgement: it’s good but it tastes instant. Not in a bad way, it’s just noticeably simpler than the sauce I make from scratch. I would keep a box around for when I feel lazy or can’t get a particular ingredient (which is why I used it this time, no 辣豆瓣酱)
60 - Bet 15, won 15.75.  Waiting post qualifying was a good thing this week for Larson.  Byron killed me.  Doubled up and got nothing.

164 - This some shit right here!!!
165 - I pledge $10 for Donnie. Please do the same if you can or better yet foster/adopt. He deserves a good life not death 
166 - Donnie #164349 is so handsome and well behaved, he is allowed to be in the office playing with his toys with minimal supervision. Yet NYCACC still see him as not GOOD ENOUGH to have the time and opportunity to find the family he so deserves. What is happening here? TBK Tuesday,…
167 - @markiplier
 thank you for the lovely stream Mark! I can’t wait for your movie. Please get some rest when you can and if you see this make sure to eat some food and drink water!
168 - Watch how much you’ll save, it was a game changer when I started paying my bills for multiple months.

183 - Good morning
184 - Good and you
185 - It’s not about the money.

I'm not giving my opinion, i'm quoting scripture. God demands us to stand for the weak, to care even for those who aren't close to us (the good samaritan)

God won't ignore your condoning of the massacre of innocents. God isn't a fool, repent.

217 - Wish everyone good luck -Kylekurlie
218 - Lol just saying. Be fair. When the team sucks, they deserve to be ripped. It’s not an agenda. When they do something good, they deserve praise. That’s how I operate anyway. Constantly being devils advocate serves to just celebrate failure.
219 - Yeah it was pretty good actually beginning of the week went slow
220 - Keep up the good work Voodoo warrior!! 
221 - "the most good will" literally what does that even mean lmao weird he is talking about the situation being nonsensical then says the most arbitrary thing imaginable

254 - Good old days
255 - Been in both situations, the human dynamic doesn't always mesh, I've known a few people who would clash with their own clones. Good management should resolve it though. Not enough context in her case: "New girl in school",  entitled attitude, male chauvinism? We don't know.
256 - Funny because in my ER, we saw both COVID and flu positives in 2020 and 2021. I mean, swabbing for both showed both existed.

298 - Pre-colonization Glass Gem Corn, Indigenous to North America, regrown by a Cherokee farmer in Oklahoma. This particular corn is a mix of ancient Pawnee, Osage and Cherokee varieties.
299 - (In general it would be good for your type of supporter of legal reform to simply grant that one cannot pursue that goal in service of a prime minister so deeply entangled in legal trouble. It's evident, in such a setting, the project becomes toxic--whatever the original merits.)

441 - Call it what you will; neocolonialism or good old-fashioned imperialism. In order to do something about it, we need to do something about our shit hole countries.
442 - Imagine if India or any developing nation could print $8 trillion out of thin air. It will be an instant transformation of the destiny. But they can’t.

Only the U.S. has this extraordinary, rigged privilege.

DT also worked harder than any modern day President to fight human trafficking. Seek like u have some homework to do on all the good he did while in the WH
461 - morning siey <3 good luck with your agendas today and don't skip your meals ^-^
462 - Miami and the Bucks are looking like a really good series. Jimmy Butler putting up an exceptional playoff performance. I though Knicks and Cavs would be the best. Miami having to fight to get in, makes them keep grinding to stay alive.
463 - Good
464 - is anyone else trying to watch love is blind reunion and it’s taking forever to load

469 - this movie was too good man
470 - A friend received SNAP during Covid, approximately $250 per month.  This helped her do two things:  buy food and prescriptions.  Now her food stamps are $50 /month.  She’s on a fixed income & decided to use SNAP the last two weeks of each month.  How much can you buy for $25?
471 - I miss making memes about my friends. I used to be cackling for 40 minutes. Good old days.

474 - I’m from Tennessee and still visit family there.  There are some good and nice people in Tennessee.   But, there are a lot of right wingers and some crazy ones at that, and it seems to be getting worse.  Can’t say I’d recommend visiting there anytime soon, if you don’t have to.
475 - Good Morning

477 - It’s going to be really funny if they cut Social Security and Medicare for the “millionaires and billionaires” you and the Socialist-Democrats who run you despise so much, who don’t need them but take them because you told them “you paid into it, it’s your money”.
478 - Societal decay, the stores will shutdown, the people won't have access to food or supplies and there won't be any commercial businesses left to rob, so they will turn to residential in large numbers. There's going to be huge no-go zones in cities. Without power, gas or water.
479 - A large mob looted an LA gas station last night. Police couldn’t intervene.
480 - plz  it would be funny if i wasnt in the spotlight

486 - In America - poor children are provided food by their parents, not the government!

498 - Newsom should take shots of Yukon Jack, chased with the Covid vaccine. It's good with Red Bull. Stop voting!  Look up "entropy." The idea of democracy is flawed. Walk away from this bullshit. You should trust me. What do you have to lose?
499 - Didn't they try to say that meat was bad last year? I'm actually wondering if this is the attempt to make us not want anything but crickets which are not good

520 - Tried out the demo for Suffer the Night since it's coming out tomorrow. It's really good. Genre-blending meta horror. Beyond the mix of gameplay, there's nothing very original here, but it's done really well, it's terrifying and very detailed.
521 - Most people are bored by the classic works of most art forms! That’s why good taste isn’t the same as popular taste. It’s okay for these two things to be different.
522 - Not a good look. This is the first round
523 - good thing she has millions of other people who love her.
524 - @elonmusk
 reason behind your success is the mind you use! 
Keep good decisions coming in future also

You will receive whatever money we receive, so that’s 70% for subscriptions on iOS & Android (they charge 30%) and ~92% on web (could be better, depending on payment processor).

After first year, iOS & Android fees…

544 - I was right though he timed him early and knocked him out

548 - I was Muslim because of marriage for 17 years. On an individual level there are definitely good ones ! As a whole/belief, no. Islam has a lot of beauty and truth, however bottom line they're worshippers of Baal.
549 - FAVORITE SPICIEST FOOD??
550 - You're not 'engaging in good faith'. You're pushing a 
 - real - racist political agenda and trying to cover it with bullshit that you believe we're stupid enough to believe is fresh clean cattle feed.
551 - That picture makes Chicago look better than it is, it's not a good place to live now.

556 - Daily $BTC Update:  
April 16, 2023

Or Was “Date Em All” Just For One Gender? Lol
562 - Prepping for the week is a pain in the ass. Just the food prep takes forever.
563 - i still think it’s interesting, and not always in a good way, what the norms have provided space to discuss, and who is allowed to discuss things

like there is tons of gender discourse, but very little race, which i personally think is a bit of a blindspot in this space
564 - No doesn’t look good for Johnson. I wonder if the Daily Telegraph will take him back or The Spectator. There’s always ‘Have I Got News For You’.

Be good to the lad that loves you true
And the soul that was born to die for you,
And whistle and I'll be there.

4) They want all Electric Vehicles that only the Government & Oligarchscan afford.
641 - God forbid you celebrate after making a good play.
642 - Funny how you weren’t outraged about your daddy raising the debt ceiling for many years to come

650 - yayy, good for you! good luck!
651 - Nah they work. Not offensively. He’s unstoppable. But watch him play defense. Everyone knows he’s going to lazily roam. That’s why random mfs turn into Curry against Lakers. The play in was the first time LeBron gave effort on both ends since 2020.
652 - Good day and how are you doing today?
653 - I like the idealism you have but the pup probably saw wheel barrow going no where so master stop wasting time and leash to walk him. Once he tied pup to WB pup realized to get walked he had to do this job first so did.

You'll save $4k a year in just fuel alone. No belts, fluid replacements, far less break usage etc.

702 - It's April 16, 2023 at 06:59PM and it's good time to not be #scammed. Have you ever noticed, how all the people tweeting positive stuff about #WalletInvestors are obviously paid or bots? the pics on the accounts the followers count? The scam doesn't end there when someone po…

723 - I don't want to get my hopes too high, but I think it would be extremely funny if vestige hawks gave AfO a TERRIBLE time. Just lay low and then back stab him in vestige space at the worst time for AfO.

753 - Good evening ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid we cannot continue to manage your strokes and heart attacks due to heavy fog.
754 - yes, I am the not funny woman
755 - It’s so good I’m on episode 7 I’m finishing tonight! 
756 - I hated the costume designs, the movie feeling generic and fully revealed from the trailers and social media similar like the TASM 2 another film that wasn't good.
The only redeeming part of this movie was Freddy and his girlfriend Anthea which he was the best character 3/4
757 - Better pray for yourself and your family instead, and get a good harvest of corn. Because if the judiciary decides to move mad that's all you'll be eating for the next 4 years
758 - good am
759 - Good job "jawan*
760 - And the solution I offered will allow me to make sure I support both title tracks equally while also being able to stream D-Day A LOT more than anyone using the playlists being suggested and I can include more Agust D tracks as fillers. It's actually a very good and smart plan.
761 - first time trying something atmospheric
i think it came out good :3
762 - #collect #cardchat #TheHobby 
hearing card shows were good all over the country this weekend.
763 -  It is a paradox for us Red Dogs:

On one hand people like Biden and Raimondo are old-style Dems not crazy "progressives".

OTOH, they are old-style Dems who think protectionism is good (if firm is unionized); have ambiguous views on immigration; and blame corps for inflation.
764 - Oh Good God its true!

781 - She didn't commit suicide she is reincarnating and the the other characters don't want her to but are accepting of the fact that it's her decision. Did you watch the episode?
782 - You are too funny, ARI

I love it.

796 - Today's my dog's bday. Everyone say happy birthday to thus good boy.
797 - Deleted my Facebook. Feels good.
798 - In a good way?
799 - I can’t find it now because it was in my fyp, but I guess that’s a good thing since it upset me so much. I understand being depressed and not thinking how you normally do but people that genuinely need help aren’t going to be mean about it. Makes me wonder if it’s for attention…
800 - Deadly funny.
801 - okay but can we also talk about how good jisung looks here like
802 - I agree with you there I think if starters can keep up with each other the bench I think we might have a slight edge but we have to play good all these games
803 - I had the audacity to suggest plants also needed to be respected in the food chain.

810 - The funny part is people think they will stop at the 2nd amendment. Let me perfectly clear ! If they take that right away they Will NOT stop there ! You wanna know why ? They have control over you . And there’s nothing we could do to stop them !
811 - Good Morning
Thank you for contacting WEMA BANK
Kindly check your DM for our response. ~Q.O
812 - I am!! Definitely good points and reaffirming sentiments  just reading random pages as I go  it was $25 at a near by sex education store!
813 - just cosplaying 2013

(tuning in to watch a reunion show on live tv)
814 - Good Morning everybody (◕ᴗ◕✿) How are you doing today?? ♡(◕ᗜ◕✿) #ENVtuber #Vtuber
815 - Yep. That's why when ever I see a kid who looks poor, I walk right up to them, and say 

"If it was up to me, you'd be dead."

Gawd, I'm so compassionate I just can't stand it.
816 - Good few
817 - Haha, unfortunately Elvis and Truman are staying with grandma.  They love grandma though so they’re gonna have a good time!
818 - Most people find it very funny and harmless my dude
819 - Can you imagine the outrage if this was posted about a POC. Reverse racism is ok though
820 - Reposting this as I watch the debate between those who think Trumpism rises and falls with Trump, vs those who see Trumpism as systemic within the GOP. 
@AGHamilton29
821 - Ooh, I know this one! Your mythical Conservatism is a niche brand of elite narcissism incapable of winning national elections. So you used evangelicals/racists/gun nuts as electoral foot soldiers. But then--whoops!--they became self-aware and realized they don't need you. twitter.com/nytdavidbrooks…
822 - Good morning

@Blind_P_Gunner
 flip flop hit from the wife. Always good to see you sir. You both are inspirations to keep on hitting it up and trying.
829 - Nah, this is wild that you can watch a live show up on Netflix. Didn't think it would be a thing. (I didn't watch the Dave Chappelle whatever he did)
830 - That’s a good question that I acknowledge is probably out of my depth. I can only assume it depends on the physiological process.
831 - One very full, very tired pup in a food coma

836 - Tubi really stepped up here lately. Watched a lot of good stuff on it
837 - Yes, the women in my gym seem to know their limits and have good form. They all seem pretty experienced, even if it’s just casual lifting. I’ve never seen a woman ready to kill herself on the bench press lol.
838 - #Yummy so good. 
839 - Good project
840 - GOOD MORNING !!! ACTRESS KIM YERIM IS COMING  [RVF]
841 - We need good Russ tonight. Set the tone brodie.
842 - Good, because my services are free of charge!
843 - After the first exploit was “fixed” with them injecting funds.. 
they promised us that the exploit was FIXED!! And then it happened again..

Millions of $ are locked for innocent investors but he thinks it’s funny when we want answers.
844 - if jackelina is not dragged today, I will never watch love is blind again
845 - No. No big hoohaa about him. Microsoft's really good about stealing money from people who sign up for a dollar transaction to talk to tech support.
846 - He's incredibly boring honestly. All he does besides traveling across states on the weekdays is smoke a fuck ton of cigarettes, drink beer, and watch political shit on TV.
847 - Really good movie, I totally need to rewatch it
848 - You’re gonna be facing Fried, Strider and Morton this week instead of Morton and 3 rookies. Good luck.
849 - it is it's so stupid and like not even in a funny way either
850 - Good Morning 
851 - Marijuana Zombies....nah lady, just some really good shit...Hell I got so high I thought I saw a lady with 3 toes on one foot....
852 - I like the idea, but she was literally willing to let every other dimension be destroyed. 

Maybe if we had seen her earlier in her exile? Watch her slowly go mad with phenomenal cosmic power in an itty bitty living space.

But the monks literally just made the key into Dawn.
853 - Who is writing your anti Harry and Megan tweets
Honest to God
Give it a rest
I wish you guys focused as much on food banks and bloomin energy price issues

864 - The popular spot out here, Tita’s Kitchen, is always out of both. 
To have both in stock ? Psh, hella good week lol
865 - Did you say pot smoking hippies?
866 - The only good thing , even tho it’s early, it doesn’t look like anybody from the NL west is running away with it.  Dodgers will figure it out. We need some key pieces from the bullpen to get back, and need Smiths bat up there too.
867 - Hei, hei, hei, let me keep quiet bacause of your profile pic. Next time remove that pic first then i can reply you. Go and watch video imbwaa iwee

870 - You cannot comfortably wear the clothes of a good relationship—love, intimacy, connection, unless you have shed the torn garments of dysfunction—criticism, negativity, and selfish demands.

They just don't fit.
